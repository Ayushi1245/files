I have and would grade it a solid B , just as CinemaScore did . Are you a fan of director Zack Snyder ?	maiMne is solid B grade karatA , jaise ki CinemaScore ne kiyA . kyA tuma director Zack Snyder kI fan ho ? 
I'm not sure . What other movies has he directed ?	meM sure nahIM hU~ , usane aura kaunasI movies direct kI hai ? 
He directed Batman vs Superman . The film takes place 18 months after the battle between General Zod and Superman . Superman becomes a controversial figure while Clark Kent learns of Batman's form of justice and seeks to expose him via Daily Planet articles .	usane Batman V Superman direct kI hai . vo movie General jor3a aura Superman kI battle ke 18 month bAda hotI hai . Superman eka controversial figure bana jAtA hai aura Clark Kent ko Batman kI Justice ke tarIke ke bAre meM patA calatA hai aura vaha use Daily Planet ke articles meM expose karanA cAhatA hai 
Has he directed anything else besides the Batman or Superman movies ?	kyA usane Batman aura Superman movie ke alAvA kucha direct kiyA hai ? 
I can't honestly say . I know he directed this film while David S . Goyer and Chris Terrio cowrote it .	Honestly , maiM bola nahIM sakatA hai . mujhe patA hai ki usane yaha film direct kI hai aura David S . Goyer aura Chris Terrio ne write ki hai 
Batman and Superman are enemies in this film ?	kyA Batman aura Superman isa film meM enemies hai ? 
They are - Lex Luthor , who is obsessed with defeating Superman , basically manipulates them into fighting each other .	vaha hai . Lex Luthor jo Superman ko hArane ko lekara obsessed hai , basically donoM ko eka dUsare ko fight karane meM manipulate kara detA hai . 
Whose side is Wonder Woman on ?	Wonder Woman kisa side pe rahatI hai . 
Well to be honest , Batman has Superman beat and just before he can kill Superman , Superman utters " save martha " to which Lane enterenters and explains Martha is his mother . Batman rescues Martha while Superman confronts Luther on the scout ship . At this point , Wonder Woman hasn't debuted yet	Well to be honest , Batman Superman ko harA detA hai aura jaise hI vaha Superman ko mArane vAlA rahatA hai , Superman bolatA hai " save martha " to Lane aMdara AtI hai aura explain karatI hai ki Martha usakI mAM hai . Batman Martha ko rescue karatA hai aura Superman scout ship pe Luthor ko confront karatA hai . isa point pe Wonder Woman aba taka debut nahIM kI hai 
Dang ! Crazy that Batman has Superman beat ! Isn't Batman just a millionaire with a lot of fancy gadgets ? Superman at least has real super powers . You would think that would give him a one-up . Did Batman have kryptonite or something ?	DhaMga ! Crazy Batman superman ko harA detA hai . kyA vaha basa eka millionaire nahIM jasake pAsa bhUta fancy gadget hai . Superman ke pAsa at least real super powers haiM . koI bhI socegA ki vaha superman jitegA . kyA Batman ke pAsa kripTonAiTa yA kucha thA ? 
I do very much agree with you ! It is puzzling but Batman has a spear he plans to kill superman with just before he utters the " Save Martha " line , halting Batman from killing him .	maiM Apase bahuta sahamata hU~ ! yaha hairAna karane vAlA hai , lekina baitamain ke pAsa eka balA hai , jisase vaha suparamain ko mArane kI yojanA banAte haiM , isase pahale ki vaha " sev maartha " lena kA upayoga karatA hai , baitamain ko mArane se roka detA hai . 
Do the join forces after that ?	kyA usake bAda senA meM zAmila hote haiM ? 
they *	ve * 
They do thankfully - Batman actually saves Martha while Superman travels to the scout ship to Confront Luther .	ve zukra manAte haiM - baitamain vAstava meM mArthA ko bacAtA hai , jabaki suparamain kA sAmanA loothar ke sAtha skAuTa jahAja taka jAtA hai . 
Does he kill Luther ?	kyA vaha ko Luther mAratA hai ? 
Luther was also the one who kidnapped Martha . He doesn't kill Luther but Luther is arrested to which Batman confronts him while he's in prison , warning that he'll always be watching .	Luther bhI vahI thA jisane maartha kA apaharaNa kiyA thA . vaha loothar ko nahIM mAratA hai , lekina loothar ko giraphtAra kara liyA jAtA hai , jisameM baitamain ne jela meM rahane ke daurAna usakA sAmanA kiyA , cetAvanI dI ki vaha hamezA dekhatA rahegA 
So basically leaving an opening for another movie in the franchise ?	to mUla rUpa se phreMcAiz2I meM eka aura films ke lie eka opening chor3a rahA hU~ ? 
I've heard debates on Superman's and Batman's outfits in this movie . Some say that they are awesome and some say that they are ridiculous and too different form their b eloved originals . What are your thoughts on this ?	maiMne isa film meM suparamain aura baitamain ke ऑTApita para bahasa sunI haiM . kucha kA kahanA hai ki ve kamAla ke haiM aura kucha kahate haiM ki ve hAsyAspada haiM aura bahuta alaga rUpa meM unakI bhI elovAyaDa mUlya haiM . isa para Apake vicAra kyA haiM ? 
They do ... Sadly , Superman dies , however , Bruce Wayne intends to form a team of Metahumans , starting with the Metahumans he found in Luthor's files to protect the world in Sueprmans absence .	we karate haiM ... Apasosa kI bAta hai ki , suparamain kI mRtyu ho jAtI hai , haalaanki , broos vena ne metaahumans kI eka teem banAne kA irAdA kiyA , metahumans ke sAtha zurU karate hue unhoMne lyoopor kI phAiloM meM sooparamain kI anupasthiti meM duniyA kI rakSA karane ke lie pAyA 
While it did seem like 153 minutes of a grown man whacking two dolls together , I still found it better than Man of Steel .	jabaki yaha aisA lagatA thA jaise eka bar3e AdamI kA do minaTa meM eka sAtha do gur3iyoM ko pakar3anA , mujhe abhI bhI maiM of steel se behatara lagA . 
Wait , Superman dies ? How ? ?	rUkU , superman mAra gayA ? kaise ? ? 
Well to be honest , at the end of the film , the dirt atop Sueprman's coffin does begin to levitate ! I think we're at the finish line ! I enjoyed chatting with you about Batman vs Superman ! I highly recommend you seeing it one day . If you agree with CinemaScore , they rated it a B so I think you'll enjoy it and encourage you to watch it ! Take care and have a great day !	bahuta ImAnadArI se film ke Akhira meM dirt superman kocoffin meM rakha dete haiM ! soco kI hama AkharI line meM haiM ! hamAre sAtha batman aura superman ke bAre meM bAta karane ko majA la . meM Apako eka dina isako dekhane kI salAha detA hU~ . yadi Apa sahamata haiM to filma kA score bhI hai mere qhayAla de Apa pasanda karoge Apa apanA khayAla rakheM aura ApakA dina acchA ho !

I suppose the acting is good due to the direction of Steven Spielberg .	mujhe lagatA acting achi hai kyoki Steven Spielberg director haiM . 
does the shark do a lot of damage	zArka bahuta adhika nukasAna karatI hai 
It starts with the shark pulling a woman that is skinny dipping down in the ocean .	isakI zuruAta zArka dvArA samudra meM DubakI lagAne vAlI eka mahilA ko khIMcane se hotI hai . 
Her name is chrissie Watkins and her remains are found on shore the next day .	usakA nAma kris votakins hai aura usake avazeSa agale dina kinAre para mile .

What I can't believe is that because of the mayor the coroner changes his ruling from shark attack to boat attack .	mujhe vizvAsa nahIM hotA ki mahaapaur kI vajaha se kaॉrnara zArka ke hamale se lekara nava ke hamale taka ke apane phaisale ko badala detA hai . 
wow what ashame	vAha kyA zarma AtI hai 
The place a bounty on the shark after he attacks another person .	vaha zArka para eka InAma rakhatA hai jaba vaha kisI anya vyakti para hamalA karatA hai .

The local fisherman do catch a shark , a tiger shark . They assume that that's the killer shark .	sthAnIya machuAre eka zArka , eka bAgha zArka ko pakar3ate haiM . ve mAnate haiM ki yaha hatyArA zArka hai . 
but i assume that the shark comes again	lekina mujhe lagatA hai ki zArka phira se AtA hai 
Oh yeah , on the fourth of July it comes up and kills the police chief's son .	oh , hA~ , cauthI julaee ko yaha AtA hai aura pulse pramukh ke beTe ko mAra detA hai . 
Did you know that jaws is actually supposed to be a great white shark ?	kyA Apa jAnate haiM ki jabar3e vAstava meM eka mahAna sapheda zArka mAnA jAtA hai ? 
that is intresting	yaha dilacaspa hai 
were they able to stop the shark	kyA ve zArka ko rokane meM sakSama the 
I think one of the best scenes is when the police chief , the shark expert , and the shark hunter all get together to on the shark hunter's boat , the Orca .	mujhe lagatA hai ki jaba pupils pramukha , zArka visheshagy , aura zArka zikArI sabhI eka sAtha zArka zikArI nAva , orakA para pahuMcate haiM to sabase acchA dRzya hotA hai . 
that sounds cool	yaha sunane meM acchA lagA 
They finally do at the end . They harpoon it while on the Orca but it get's away .	we aMta meM karate haiM . have orakA para rahate hue aise parezAna karate haiM lekina yaha dUra ho jAtA hai . 
It attacks the boat and eats the shark hunter .	yaha nAva para hamalA karatA hai aura sArka zikArI ko kahA jAtA hai . 
wow that must be scary	vaha jo DarAvanA honA cAhie 
Then the police chief stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into it's mouth and shoots the tank .	phira pulls pramukha eka dabAvayukta skUbA tank ko mu~ha meM bharate haiM aura tank ko golI mArate haiM .

I agree . I'm slightly disappointed by the Rotten Tomatoes score . Then again , it is the first time that Pixar has made a prequel film .	maiM sahamata huIM . meM z2arA Rotten Tomatoes ke score se disappointed huIM . phira se , yaha pahalI bAra hai ki Pixar ne eka prequel film banAI hai . 
Do you typically watch movies like Monster's University ?	kyA Amataura para Monster's University jaisI movies dekhate ho ? 
Typically no since i generally like to watch anime . But if the franchise is one i watched when i was a kid . Then I usually will make a effort to see it .	jyAdAtara nahIM maiM Amataura para anime movies dekhatA huIM . lekina jaba maiM baccA thA to eka hI franchise dvArA banAI gaI movies dekhatA thA . to maiM Amataura para aisI movies dekhane kI koziza karatA huIM . 
And i agree those scores kinda seem rather low .	aura maiM mAnatA hUM ki vaha score thor3e kama laga rahe haiM . 
I understand . Just by glancing at the ratings , do you think you'd make an effort to go see the prequel ? Or would the score discourage you from seeing the film ?	maiM samajhatA huIM . sirpha ratings to dekha kara , tumheM lagatA hai ki isa prequel ko dekhane kI koziza karate ? yaha score tumheM movie dekhane ke lie discourage karate haiM ? 
Id still see it despite bad reviews . I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not . Like if 99 % of people say its bad or good . I usually won't follow what i hear . I just go and experience it for myself . And then from there I usually say its cool or say its bad .	maiM isase burI reviews milane ke bAda bhI dekhUMgA . meM z2ayAdAtara cIjeM khuda dekha kara decide karanA pasanda karatA huIM ki mujhe pasaMda hai yA nahIM . jaise agara 99 % loga kahate haiM ki ye burI hai yA achi . meM Amataura para bAteM sunna kara unake pIche nahIM jAtA . maiM basa calA jAtA huIM aura khuda se experience karatA huIM . aura phira maiM Amataura para batA huIM kI yaha bar3hiyA hai yA burI . 
Makes sense . I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with . If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings , I usually will wait to hear from friends / family before paying to see it .	samajha meM AtA hai . meM jayAdAtara taba ratings pe dhayAna dete huIM jaba meM director ko janatA huIM . agara mujhe patA hai ki Amataura para unakA kAma bahuta zAnadAra hai aura usa eka movie kI bahuta burI ratings , maiM Amataura para usape paise lagAne se pahale friends / family se sunna lete huIM . 
Also im a fan of comedy movies . So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes .	sAtha hI meM mujhe comedy movies bhI pasaMda hai . to maiM zAyada mema aura jokes enjoy karUMgA . 
Ya same .	maiM bhI . 
Comedy movies are always a must see in my book .	Comedy movies merI book meM must sI haiM

He's only seven when he goes on the field trip . He goes to college eleven years later . So he'd be eighteen .	vo sirpha seven thA jaba vo field trip pe jAtA hai . vo gyAraha sAla bAda college ko jAtA hai . to vo aba aTThAraha kA hogA . 
I misread that at first too .	maiMne bhI yaha pahalI misread kiyA 
ahhh I see well that clears that up .	Aha mujhe lagatA hai yaha saba clear kara detA hai 
Looks like this movie is pretty heavily based on cartoon fraternities .	lagatA hai ye movie kAphI heavily cartoon fraternities para based hai . 
yep	yep 
I find it odd that Pixar has a scene in this movie where Sulley tampers with the machine to get better scores . Doesn't really promote the whole ' fair play ' imagine to their age demographic .	mujhe thor3A odd lagA , isa movie meM pixar ke lie yaka scene haiM , jahAM surley tampers with the machine ne better score kiye ... Ajakala kA demographic meM airplay ne promote nahIM kiyA 
Oozma Kappa . I can't believe they threw a kappa meme in there .	Uz2amA kappA . mujhe nahIM lagatA koI kappA kA mema banegA 
Every movie with a fraternity / sorority always contains ' Kappa . ' Ever notice that ?	hara movie meM kappA kA fraternity / sorority banAyA . kyA Apa notice nahIM kiyA 
ya . Its pretty much a dead meme .	hA~ .. pretty dead mema thA 
Am i slow for thinking hardscrabble was male until this passage ? lol	kyA maiM slow hoM , hardscrabble yaka mAlI ko think karane meM 
Wonder what CDA stands for in this movie . Clearly , it's some form of an enforcer but what type of enforcer does a monster have ?	kor3A to isa movie ke lie stands kiye ... clearly , kucha enforcer form kare aura monster ke pAsa kisa tAre kA enforcer haiM 
idk maybe to make sure they are scary enough .	yaha kucha scary kI taraha bhI ho sakatI 
Nope ! I thought the same . I think it was because there was no gender context to go off of in the last paragraph .	nahIM , mujhe bhI aise hI kucha lagatA , .. kyoM ki isa meM kucha gender context nahIM haiM 
yeah probably .	hAM 
Well it sounds like a safe movie for the kids .	to yaha kids ke lie to safe movie haiM 
No , I don't think it's to make sure they're scary enough ... the CDA has to be some form of a cop as they are removing them off campus due to their expulsion from the university .	nahIM , mujhe nahIM lagatA ye itanA bhI scary hogA ... CDA ne cop ko form kiyA aura use campus se expulsion karane ke lie university Ate 
Although i expect a few hidden adult jokes cause college and fraternity makes me think they slip one or two in there .	thor3A hidden adult jokes haiM usa college aura fraternity ne to yaka yA do slip jarUra liyA hogA 
Ah i see that would make sense .	Aha , aba huI na bAta 
I agree . I was skeptical about the cheating portion of the movie as that doesn't coincide with a kids film and what you'd want to teach the kids at this age level but they do bring in negative reinforcers for the monster's actions , .	maiM mAnatA hU~ .. usa cheating portion is movie meM jo skeptical haiM , lekina kids film ke lie to bilkula coincide nahI hUvA ... isa sAla ke baccoM ko kyA sIkhane chaThe ye to pUrA negative reinforces haiM usa monsters kA action kA 
True . Movies these days are getting so caught up in formulaic tropes that kids pick up on them .	saca .. ina dinno meM movies to itanA formulaic tropes haiM , jo kids ko nahIM dekha sakate 
I hope the movie stays fresh and a bit unpredictable .	movies tho fresh aura unpredictable honA merA hope haiM 
Keep the kids on their toes .	kids ko to hama hamAre toes meM rakhanA cAhie 
One can only hope .	hara kisI kA hope haiM 
And still be smart enough to let the parents enjoy it .	smart bhI rahanA cAhie , jo parents bhI enjoy kara sakate 
A 79 % on a kids movie doesn't seem too bad in my opinion after reading the key scenes .	79 % kids movie tho bad hI hotA merA opinion se , keys ko bar3hane kI bAta 
Thats why past pixar films in my opinion were so good . And still seem better than movies today .	isalie piksAra kA purAnI FILMS acchA rahatI , mere khayAla se ... aura Aja bhI IS MOVIES BETTER hai 
Thats true . I think overall it sounds like a good movie .	yaha to saca haiM ... OVERALL yaha kucha ache MOVIE SOUNDS karatA 
Hi , do you think this movie deserved a 92 % Rotten Tomatoes score ? That seems awfully high .	hai , kyA ROTTEN TOMATOES 92 % diyA jo DESERVED haiM ? vo THO AWFULLY HIGH hai yAra 
It's hard to say , They are usually my go to website for reviews but its rare you see a score in the 90 % area .	USUALLY vaha REVIEWS ke lie WEBSITE jAtI , lekina RARE se unako 90 % AREA ko dekhane pe lete 
I have noticed that too ! I love Octavia Spencer in anything she does .	maiM bhI yaha NOTICED kiyAhoM . mujhe OCTAVIA SPENCER pasaMda haiM 
I don't know much of her work but I am a big fan of Guillermo Del Toro	mujhe unakA WORK ke bAre meM kucha patA nahIM , lekina maiM GUILLERMO DEL Toro kA bar3I pana hU~ 
and it seems the critics had alot to say on this film as well !	aura CRITICS THO IS FILM ke lie kAphI kucha kahane ko hai 
I'll have to check out his other films . I am impressed that a movie about a humanoid amphibian creature could be described as " elegant and mesmerizing " .	maiM dUsarI FILMS ME CHECK OUT karU~gA .. maiM IS MOVIE se IMPRESSED hoM , US HUMANOID AMPHIBIAN CREATURE se jo ELEGANT aura MESMERIZING se DESCRIBED kiye haiM 
that is quite the compliment indeed , I have yet to see the it but i definitely plan too . are you a fan of drama films ?	vaha thor3A COMPLIMENT haiM , INDEED mujhe dekhanA pasaMda haiM , maiM jarUra PLAN karUMgI , AAP DRAMA FILMS kA FAN ho ? 
I really love drama films , but I try to stay away from fantasy . I liked this one , though .	mujhe DRAMA FILMS pasaMda haiM , lekina maiM FANTASY TRY karu~gI . mujhe vo pasaMda haiM 
The acting by Michael Shannon and Octavia Spencer was impressive .	MICHAEL SHANNON aura OCTAVIA SPENCER kA ACTING to IMPRESSIVE haiM 
Hi , how are you ?	hello , tuma kaise ho ?

Why not La La land ? Do you not like it ?	kyoM nahIM lA lA paine ? kyA Apako yaha pasaMda nahIM hai ? 
What genre is La La land ?	kyA zailI laha laha bhUmi hai ? 
LA LA land is OK but it doesn't compare to the action of Jews . I give it a 7.8 whereas jaws is a 9.1	la la bhUmi ThIka hai , lekina yaha yahUdiyoM kI kArravAI kI tulanA nahIM karatA hai . meM ise 7.8 detA hU~ jabaki jabar3e 9.1 hai 
LA LA land is a musical romantic Comedy	la la bhUmi eka saMgItamaya romantic kaॉmeDI hai 
Hmm , you might have to convince me a little more about Jaws just because I already know the ending . Since you said LA LA Land is a romantic comedy , is there any romance in Jaws ?	hama , tuma mujhe jabar3e ke bAre meM thor3A aura samajhAne ke lie ho sakatA hai kyoMki maiM pahale se hI aMta jAnatA hU~ . jaba se Apane kahA thA ki lA lA paine eka romantic kaॉmeDI hai , kyA jaॉz2a meM koI romaans hai ?

No . Jaws has little romance	nahIM , jabar3e meM thor3A romaans hai 
Hi	hai 
what is the name of the movie ?	usa movie kA nAma kyA hai ? 
Bruce Almighty	Bruce Almighty

I keep meaning to watch it but seem to always forget	maiM to aba bhI isa movie ko watch karanA cuvaMgA lekina mujhe almost bhUla gayA 
So Carreys character , Bruce Nolan , is a reporter . Hardworking , but not very successful . He has a lot of bad luck and reaches his limit when his co worker receives a promotion over him	to carries kA character , bruce nolan haiM jo reporter haiM . hardworking lekina successful nahIM haiM . usakA bad luck bahuta haiM to vaha limit meM nahIM raca hotA jaba usa coworker nahI promotion ke lie gayA to 
He then starts his complaints to God who ends up responding with the proposition that gives him his powers	to vaha God ke pAsa calA jAtA aura kAphI complaints karatA aura usako proposition kA power mila jAtA 
So its like walk in someone else's shoes to see what they have to deal with .	to ye aise kucha haiM ki dUsaroM kA soe meM ghusakara usakA problem kyA haiM karake deal karatA . 
More as in " why God leaves some prayers unanswered "	jyAdA hone se patA nahIM kyoM bhagavAna ne kucha prathnaon ko unasunanA kara diyA 
oh ok	acchA ThIka hai 
Bruce starts responding with yeses to all the prayers he receives , and as you can imagine that's were a lot of the conflict AND comedy come in to play	bruce milI huI prathnaon ko hAM meM javAba dene lagegA , aura jaise tuma soca sakate ho vahAM para kAphI saMgharSa aura comedy huI 
I enjoy comedy that is funny but has a good story line .	mujhe vaha comedy achi lagatI hai jo funny bhI ho aura achi kahAnI sAtha ho 
oh yea this one definetly has both and then the story to with Jennifer Annistons character as well	acchA ye ika pakke rUpa meM doMno aura phira Jennifer Annistons ke character ke sAtha hI kahAnI hai

Hi there !	Hi there ! 
Hello , have you seen Monsters University ?	hailo , kyA Apane monsters university dekhI hai ? 
Hi	hai 
This movie is about how Facebook got started by Mark Zuckerberg , it's called " The Social Network " . Interesting to watch because it's based on real events .	Mark Zuckerburg ne Facebook kaise start kiyA movie isa bAre meM hai , isakA nAma hai " The Social Network " . dekhane meM bahuta interesting hai kyoMki yaha real events pe base haiM . 
I have heard of that movie before	maiMne isa movie ke bAre meM pahale bhI sunA hai 
Although I haven't watched it before	Although maiMne pahale dekhI nahIM hai 
It was more popular than the book it was based on , The Accidental Billionaires , probably because it's a tale of Sex , Money , and Betrayal . Stuff we can all identify with	yaha jisa kitAba para yaha AdhArita hai usase bhI jyAdA popular hai , The Accidental Billionaires , probably because ye kahAnI hai Sex , Money aura dhokhe kI , vo stuff jisake sAtha hama saba identify karate haiM . 
Oh that is really interesting	oh yaha to really interesting hai 
It makes it sound more intriguing than before	yaha to pahale se jyAdA intriguing sound kara rahA hai 
Have you seen it	kyA Apane dekhI hai 
Yes , we've all heard of Facebook , but the story of how it got started is pretty surprising . I didn't believe everything I saw in the movie , but it held my interest	yes , hama sabane Facebook ke bAre meM sunA hai , but yaha zurU kaise huA usakI story kAphI surprising hai . movie meM jo dekhA usa saba para believe to nahIM huA , para merA interest isameM banA rahA 
I think sometimes they add information to movies just to keep the audience entertained	I think sometime ye movie meM kucha information sirpha isa interesting aura audience ko entertained rakhane ke lie karate haiM . 
Which is understandable because you don't want a boring movie	yaha understandable hai because koI bhI boring movie nahIM cAhatA . 
I had no idea it was a book thogh	mujhe bilkula idea nahIM thA kI vo book hai 
No doubt , It is a drama . Zuckerberg and the current staff weren't involved in making the movie , it has a kind of dark irony , but one of the founders , Eduardo Saverin , was consulted by the book's author .	bezaka yaha drama hai . Zuckerberg aura current staff kA koI involvement nahIM thA movie banAne , isameM kucha dark irony hai lekina eka founder , Eduardo Saverin ne book ke author se mulAkAta kI 
I am sure there is information that they didn't want to leak in the movie and even the book	mujhe yakIna hai kucha information hai jo vo loga movie yA book meM lekha nahIM karanA cAhate 
So would you recommend seeing this movie ? It a couple of years old if not older .	to kyA Apa ye movie dekhanA recommend karate haiM ? yaha kucha sAla purAnI hai agara aura jyAdA purannI nahIM hai to 
Yes , it's an engaging look at that time period when websites were just getting started . Some of the lawsuits that came out of those beginnings might still be on going .	hAM , yaha engaging look hai usa vakta meM jaba websites basa zurU ho rahe the . kucha lawsuits jo jaba zuruAta meM nikale the zAyada bhAI bhI cala rahI hai 
I believe it . I remember reading about the lawsuits when they were filed . I think they have great lawyers to protect themselves though ...	mujhe yakIna hai . mujhe yAda hai maiMne par3hA thA jaba lawsuits file hue the . mere qhayAla se unake pAsa khuda ko bacAne ache lawyers hai 
The film starts in 2003 when Zuckerberg was a 19 year old student at Harvard . He actually created a campus website called Facemash that allowed users to rate the attractiveness of photos of female students .	film zurU hotI hai 2003 meM jaba Zuckerberg 19 sAla kA student thA Harvard meM . usane asala pakImasa nAma kI campus website banAI jisameM users female students ke photos ke attractiveness ko rate kara sakate the 
That is a really good overall description for someone who wants a synapse of the movie .	yaha pUre taura para bahuta acchA description hai unaloga ke lie jinako movie kA synapse cAhie 
Oh , that's just the beginning . That website was so popular it got the attention of the Winklevoss twins , who were upper class men who made a dating website exclusive to Harvard . So the origins of the idea for the site are kind of vague	Oh , vo to basa zuruAta hai . vo website itanI popular hai kI isako Winklevoss twins kA attention milA , jo Upara class meM the jinhoM ne Harvard ke lie exclusive dating website banAyI 
Is the company protected by a patent or some kind of legal documents ?	kyA company kucha patent yA legal documents kI hiphAjata meM hai 
I don't know , but Zuckerberg was given 6 months academic probation for hacking into college databases and crashing the Harvard computer network . So he's aware of what kind of damage a rogue programmer can do .	maiM nahIM jAnatA , para Zukerbreg ko college database ko hack karane aura harward computer network ko crash karane ke lie 6 months kA academic probation milA thA . So vo isa bAta se aware hogI ki rogue programmer kisa prakAra kA damage kara sakate haiM . 
As a programmer I could see the damage that can be done by hacking into databases and networks .	As a programmer me yaha dekha sakatA hU~ ki databases aura networks meM hacking se jo nukasAna ho sakatA hai . 
damage was bound to happen in this situation	damage is situation me hone ke lie bounded thA . 
So you also know that programming knowledge doesn't necessarily translate to business smarts . It's when Zuckerberg gets hooked up with Napster co-founder Sean Parker that the business really starts to take off	So tuma bhI yaha jAnate ho ki business ko smart translate karane ke lie programming kA knowledge necessary nahIM hai . ye jaba zukerberg ne Napster ke co-founder sena parker se hooked up kiyA , isa se business really me take off karanA start karatA hai . 
I had totally forgotten about using Napster . I use to always use it . Had no idea he co-f ounded it .	maiM Npaster ko use karane ke bAre meM totally bhUla gayA thA . Me use hamezA use karane kA AdI hUM . mujhe koI idea nahIM ki vo isakA co-founder haiM 
There were other social networks before The Facebook , too , which is what Zuckerberg called it while expanding the site to Yale , Columbia , and Stanford . I liked Napster , too , and had a MySpace account . But that all changed after Parker suggested they drop ' The ' and move Facebook to Palo Alto .	Facebook ke pahale bhI other social networks the , jo ki zuckerberg ne kahA thA jaba vo site ko yela , columbia aura stanford meM expand kara rahe the . mujhe pester bhI pasaMda hai , aura mere Myspace kA account bhI hai . But yaha saba badala gayA jaba parker ne suggest kiyA facebook to pAlo alto . 
I I also had a MySpace account but haven't logged in roughly 2 years .	mere pAsa bhI Myspace account hai para maiMne kabhI hai 2 years me logged in kiyA . 
Been a while for me , too . Parker ended up sharing a house in Palo Alto with Zuckerberg , leaving his partner Saverin in New York to work on " Business Development " . Meanwhile they were developing plans for the business in California to make a billion dollar company .	mere lie thor3I dera ho gayI . pakar3a ne zuckerberg ke sAtha house sharing khatma kara dI pAlo alto meM , apane partner saverin ko new york meM hI business development kA kAma karane ke lie chor3a diyA . Meanwhile vo california meM billion dollar kI company ke business plan ko develop karane lage . 
That is crazy . To have potentially in a company to make a billion dollar company is mind blowing	yaha crazy thA . unake pAsa company ko million dollar kI company banane kA potential hai jo ki mind blowing hai . 
Well , Saverin and the Winklevoss twins tried to keep their interests in the company . The film is intercut with scenes from their depositions in the cases against Zuckerberg . They eventually settled out of court because Zuckerberg's defense thinks he will appear unsympathetic to a jury .	Well , Saverin aura winkles jur3avAM ne apanA interests company meM rakhane kA try kiyA . Film meM una scenes ko intercut kara diyA jisameM Zuckerberg ke against deposition case the . unhoMne eventually court ke bAhara hI settle kara liyA , zukerberg kI defense socate haiM ki vo jury ko unsympathetic appear hogI . 
Well if he wasn't going to seem unsympathetic than maybe it was the best choice for the defense	to , agara vo unsympathetic ke lie nahIM jAegA to defense hI usakA best choice rahegA 
No doubt , the film has lots of sordid details about the founding and the callous attitude Zuckerberg had towards his collaborators . But the end , when he's sending a friend request , is when it get's really weird .	no doubt , film meM to kahIM sordid details haiM usa founding aura callous kA attitude ke bAre meM , zuckerberg to usa collaborators kI sA sAtha haiM .. lekina end meM , jaba usane usako friend ko request diyA to thoDA weird feel huvA 
Ugh I hate endings that either leave cliff hangers or just ends with no explanation of the future events	ugh , maiM end hate karatA kyoM ki vaha cliff hangers ko nahIM chor3A aura end meM kucha explanation bhI nahIM diyA usa future events ko 
I hear you . This ending has to deal with a world where Superman is absent , and after every one leaves , the dirt on top of Clark's coffin starts rising into the air . How about that !	maiM suna liyA .. ending tho world he deal karanA cAhie , lekina superman absent they aura sabhI yaka ke pIche chor3a rahI thI , clears kA coffins upper se dirt ur3a rahA thA havA meM . kaise huvA ye saba

Really ? The first time ? That seems pretty amazing knowing that the characters have been around for so long ! Very cool . Is the story set in Metropolis or Gotham ?	Really ? pahalI bAra ? yaha jAnate hue kI donoM character itane time se haiM ye cIz2a to bahuta amazing hai . bahuta cool . Story Metropolis meM set hai ki gotham meM ? 
The film appears to take place in both cities , and Batman comes to view Superman as a threat to humanity .	aisA lagatA hai ki film donoM cities meM hotI hai , aura Batman ko lagatA hai ki Superman humanity ke lie eka threat hai . 
That is interesting , to have the film set in both cities . So Batman sees it as his duty somewhat to take Superman down ?	yaha to interesting hai yAra , is film to donoM cities ke haiM . to batman ko AsAna par3egA usa superman kA duty karane meM ? 
Well the relationships of the characters are quite complex because Clark Kent A . K . A . Superman learns of Batman's justice methods and tries to expose him . All this happening while Lex luthor makes moves to get approval to obtain kryptonite from a senator .	tho is characters kA relationships to bar3A complex haiM yAra kyoM ki clark kent ke vajAya . superman to batmans kA justice method learn kiyA aura use expose bhI kiyA . to leksa luthor ne kryptonite ko approval kiyA usa senator se 
Interesting . And so , I imagine Lois Lane is in this story ? If so , does she serve a greater purpose ? Does she know both superheroes ?	interesting yAra , maiM aba isa story ko imagine kI .. to usakA greater purpose kyA haiM ? kyA vaha donoM superheroes ko jAnatI haiM ? 
Maybe but I am not sure . By the way do you usually care about reviews ?	maiM kucha sure nahIM hU~ . kyA Apa reviews ke anusAra movie dekhane calate ? 
I will often read reviews to see what people have to say , but I don't change my mind about wanting to see a movie based on reviews . I think that I can't really know unless I see for myself . Do you care about reviews ?	maiM to reviews ke anusAra hI jAtA ki kaise logoM isa movie ko dekhatI lekina maiM reviews se apanA mind change nahIM karatA . mujhe lagatA haiM ki yaha saba bakavAsa haiM . kyA Apa review ko kareM karate ? 
Not usually I like to be my own judge however if the reviews are overwhelmingly bad or good then it may influence whether or not I watch in theatres . I have to say for this movies though the reviews are quite mixed .	nahIM yAra maiM apane Apa judge karatA .. lekina kucha reviews to overwhelmingly acchA yA burA hotA jo mujhe theaters meM movie dekhate samaya relate karatA hU~ . mujhe lagatA haiM ki isa movies kA reviews thor3A mixed haiM 
Did you enjoy this film ?	kyA Apa isa film ko enjoy kiyA ? 
I did . I really liked seeing the scenes where batman manages to subdue the superman .	hA~ yAra .. mujhe vakI meM isa scene pasaMda haiM .. batman to superman ko kisI taraha manage kara rahA thA 
Cool . I guess that's one of the ultimate questions , which one could beat out the other . Do they team up at all in the film ?	cool .. to kaunasA yaha beat karegA ? kyA yaha film teamup hogA ? 
Yes in Batman chooses to save Supermans mother while Superman confonts Lex .	hA~ ... isameM to batman ne superman kA mom ko bacAnA ke lie choose kiyA lekina superman to laksa ko confine 
Oh wow ! The pairing of Batman and Superman's mom is a really cool part of the story , heartwarming .	oh wow ! Batman aura Superman kI mom kI pairing really sabase cool part thA story kA , heartwarming . 
I know but the film ends with sadly the death of Superman .	I know but sadly fim kA end Superman kI death ke sAtha hotA hai . 
Oh wow ! I am surprised by that , I thought they would keep their story line going for another movie or two .	oh wow ! mujhe surprise huA isase , I thought vo loga apanI story line ko Age bar3hane deMge Age kI eka do aura movie ke lie . 
Dont worry the dirt on top of the coffin vibrates a nice wink from the Director .	Don't worry coffin ke Upara kI dhUla ko hilate hue dikhAyA director ne kisI bar3hiyA wink kI taraha . 
Haha ! That's the closing shot ? !	haha ! vo to closing shot thA ? ! 
I believe so it is in the last scene .	I believe so yaha last scene meM hai na 
Awesome ! Take care .	awesome ! take care 
Hello ! Do you like superhero movies ?	Hello ! kyA tumheM superhero movies pasaMda hai ? 
yes . batman begins ! I think this a great batman film . have you seen it ?	hAM . Batman begins ! mujhe lagatA hai vo eka bar3hiyA batman film hai , kyA tumane dekhI hai ? 
Yes , I have . Christian Bale is my favorite Batman so far .	hA~ maiMne dekhI hai . Christian Bale mere aba taka kA favorite Batman hai 
Do you usually check the ratings of movies before you see them ?	kyA tuma usually movie dekhane se pahale usakI ratings dekhate ho ? 
I usually do . but the rating dose not determine whether i will watch the movie or not	Usually hA~ , but rating se yaha determine nahIM hotA ki maiM movie dekhUMgA yA nahIM 
The film has several great big name actors , which is another reason I like this one and would watch it based on the actors alone	Is film meM bahuta bar3e bade actors bhI haiM , jo ki eka aura reason hai aura actors dekha ke hI movie dekha legI 
I agree , there are quite a few great actors in Batman Begins . I like Liam Neeson too , even though he is one of the villains .	maiM agree karatA hU~ , kucha bahuta bar3hiyA actors hai Batman Begins meM . mujhe Liam Neeson bhI pasaMda hai , bhale hI vo eka villain hai 
seeing the potential for great actors together on a big screen defiantly gets my interest . along with super heros and villans . a good rating does help me feel like I will not waste my time watching something awful	bar3hiyA actors kA sAtha meM bar3I screen meM hone kA potential meM definitely merA interest . Superheros aura villains ke sAtha huI . eka good rating se mujhe yaha feel karane meM AsAnI hotI hai ki kucha bekAra dekha ke apanA time waste nahIM karA hai . 
but the same time will not deter me from a film If i am just into the genre	But at the same time vo mujhe movie dekhane se roka nahIM sakatA jisakI genre meM maiM bahuta interested ho . 
I personally prefer good ratings . Even if a movie has many good actors , if it's rated poorly , I usually won't watch it in theaters .	maiM good ratings ko prefer karatI .. agara movies meM kitanI bhI ache actors hote to bhI rated poorly haiM dete jo maiM kabhI theaters meM nahI watch karatA 
I'm not sure if I agree with the Metacritic Score of 70/100 , though .	maiM itanA sure nahIM haiM , metacritic score 70/100 diyA 
The 84 % on Rotten Tomatoes seems more accurate .	rotten tomatoes ne 84 % ne diyA jo accurate haiM 
I will generally have enough patience to wait for a film to be released on DVD / Video if the rating turn me off .	maiM to patience se wait karatA aura DVD / video meM hI dekhatA .. 
What did you think of the bat scene in the movie ?	to Apako isa movie meM bAta scene ke bAre meM kyA socate ? 
I felt that scene shows the story of this film well , and is thought out .	mujhe lagA , usa scene isa story ko showup kiyA , jo thought out haiM 
I wonder if there was a better place for the bats besides a dry well , though .	mujhe lagatA haiM ki bAta keliye usa dry well ke alAvA bhI aura kucha ache jaga milegA 
batman as a child was good step by the filmm aker to show how his life started out	batman , baccoM ko ache film haiM . kyoM ki unheM life kA startup milegA 
Because this movie is called Batman Begins , I agree that it was appropriate to show Bruce's beginnings .	are isa movie ko batman begins kA nAma diyA haiM lekina mujhe lagatA isako bruce kA beginning denA cAhie 
I think it's ironic that the mugger's name is Joe Chill , but he isn't chill if he murders people .	hA~ jaॉya chill ke lie to yaha ironic haiM , kitane chill se vo people ko murder karatA 
unlikely yes , I think they were going for a mysterious beginning to show how batman came to be . but still want to leave some mystery as he still develops a phobia to the bats	zAyada hA~ , mujhe lagatA hai ki vo loga batman kaise banA usake mysterious zuruvAta batAne jA rahe the . para thor3I mystery cudanA cAhatA hU~ kyoki use abhI bhI bats se phobia ho jAtA hai 
very ironic . mr chill is more of a bone chilling murderer .	bahuta ironic hai . more chill bone chilling murderer hai . 
He is also murdered too , so at least he gets what he deserves .	isane bhI khUna kiyA hai , so jAo vaha deserve karatA hai usako mila gayA . 
he got whats coming to him . but bruce dosent get to murder him so i think that leaves him wanting revenge	usako patA cala gayA thA usake sAtha kyA hone vAlA hai . para Bruce usakA khUna nahIM karegA isIliye mujhe lagatA hai ki usameM revenge kI bhAvanA rahegI 
I think it helps to establish that Bruce will not directly murder anyone . Even when he burns down the League of Shadows , he doesn't directly kill Ra's al Ghul .	mujhe lagatA hai ki Bruce kisIkA khUna nahI karegA aisA establish karanA acchA hogA . vo jaba League of Shadows ko jalA dete haiM taba bhI vaha Ra's ala gula ko directly nahIM maregA . 
Injustice should be not be used as a reason to murder , in any case .	kisI bhI case meM khUna kA kAraNa anyAya nahIM batAyA jA sakatA . 
I feel hes lucky become part of the league of shadows , and to purge his fear of bats . this key part I think is pretty lucky break for him . as he is doing jail time in a foreign country .	vaha lucky haiM ki vo League of Shadows kA part banA hai aura usane apane bats kI dhAra ko bhagA diyA hai . mujhe lagatA hai ki yaha important part usake liye lucky break sAbita hogA . kyukI vo foreign country kI jela meM haiM . 
It is strange that his family could afford a butler but he goes to prison for stealing ...	yaha bilkula ajIba bAta hai ki isakI family naukara afford kara zakti hai phira bhI vaha jela meM corI karane jAtA hai 
I really like Gary Oldman as Gordon . He plays a good cop really well .	Gordon ke kiradAra meM mujhe Gary Oldman bahuta acchA lagatA hai . vaha acche police vAle kA kiradAra acchI taraha nibhAte haiM . 
What did you think of the Scarecrow scenes ?	Scarecow scenes ke bAre meM Apake kyA vicAra haiM ? 
The scarecrow was particularly scary character . trying to poison the water supply	Scarecrow to bar3I scary character haiM . vo to water supply ko poison kara rahA thA 
and batman was poisoned with the fear-inducing drugs , I thought it was over for him .	aura batman bhI poisoned havA usa fear inducing drugs se , maiM to usakA jAna khatare meM haiM . 
It appeared to be over for many characters in this movie at different points , yeah .	usakA character to over ho cukA thA kahIM movie meM 
I was surprised when the real Ra's al Ghul showed himself , too . The League of Shadows doesn't die easily .	mujhe to surprised havA jaba Ra's kA real face usane dekhAI to , vaha League kA shadows bhI itanA AsAna nahIM thA 
He seems to have otherworldy power after surviving his past experiences	yaha to otherworldly power kA surviving to usakA past experiences haiM
